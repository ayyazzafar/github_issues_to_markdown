## Guide to Use

1. **Generate Sitemap**:
   - Run `github_issues_to_sitemap.xml.py` to generate an XML sitemap from all issues in the specified GitHub repository.
   - This will create a file named `sitemap.xml` in the current directory.

2. **Convert to Markdown**:
   - Run `github_issues_sitemap_to_markdown.py` to crawl the URLs from the sitemap and save the content as markdown files.
   - The markdown files will be saved in the `crawled_docs` directory.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

Feed the generated markdown files into a Language Model (LLM) for RAG. This allows the model to generate responses that are augmented with relevant information from the GitHub issues.

### 2. **Documentation Generation**

Automatically generate documentation from GitHub issues. This can be particularly useful for open-source projects where issues often contain valuable information for users and contributors.

### 3. **Knowledge Base Creation**

Create a knowledge base from GitHub issues. This can be used for internal documentation, FAQs, or support articles.

### 4. **Issue Tracking and Analysis**

Analyze GitHub issues to identify trends, common problems, and areas for improvement. The markdown files can be used as a basis for more detailed analysis.

### 5. **Content Aggregation**

Aggregate content from multiple GitHub repositories into a single markdown file or directory. This can be useful for creating comprehensive documentation or reports.
